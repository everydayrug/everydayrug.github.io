    <h1 class="">Everyday Rug</h1> 
    <p>Everyday Rug is a new NFT art project dedicated to all the winners and losers in crypto. Each artwork comes with a small story of fortune or pain. New work daily until we hit 6,900.</p>
    <p>For now work is minted on the Polygon network via <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/everydayrug">OpenSea</a>. The plan is to move to the XRPL ledger and build a marketplace when the <a href="https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/46">XLS-20d</a>  spec is ready.</p>
    <p>If you would like to contribute a story please reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/everydayrug">Twitter</a> with the hashtag <strong>#EverydayRugStory</strong>, we would be happy to share the royalties or gift an NFT. Our goal is to see this become a community project.</p>
